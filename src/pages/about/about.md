Heather’s first therapy was quantum biofeedback, utilizing the QXCI/EPFX. She then added NAET (Nambutripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique), Quantum Touch, and Reiki, along with other techniques. She also works with laser color therapy and the BioMat, which uses infrared heat and helps soothe clients during treatments.

She lives with her husband and two daughters in the Sierra Foothills - rural Sonora, California. Her home office is set in the middle of an organic apple orchard. The peaceful environment is conducive to relaxation, rejuvenation and healing.

Treatments with Heather can be done in person or remotely
