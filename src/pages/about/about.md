As a wellness educator since 2000, Heather Watson is passionate about helping people to improve their health. Over the years, she has worked with several hospitals to create wellness programs, plan and coordinate health conferences and produce a medical talk radio show.

In 2005, Heather created Conscious Wellness with the mission to help heal her clients and empower them to attain the optimal health they want and deserve.

Heather’s first therapy was quantum biofeedback, utilizing the QXCI/EPFX. She then added NAET (Nambutripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique), Quantum Touch, and Reiki, along with other techniques. She also works with laser color therapy and the BioMat, which uses infrared heat and helps soothe clients during treatments.

She lives with her husband and two daughters in the Sierra Foothills - rural Sonora, California. Her home office is set in the middle of an organic apple orchard. The peaceful environment is conducive to relaxation, rejuvenation and healing.

Treatments with Heather can be done in person or remotely.
