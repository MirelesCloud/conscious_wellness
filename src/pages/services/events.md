### Certified Fire Walking Instructor

In 2012 I was certified through the Firewalking Center which is one of the most experienced schools in the world featuring Tolly Burkan the father of the fire walking movement in the US. http://www.thefirewalkingcenter.com/ The experience of firewalking is one that people will never forget. Is an empowerment exercise that helps individuals as well as team building for corporate events.

Firewalkeing demonstrates how our thoughts impact everything else in our lives. Thoughts change brain chemistry, which changes our body chemistry, which changes our lives. When you are walking over the coals you must pay close attention to your thoughts since that will determine if you are going to have a positive experience or not. It is an example of extreme spirituality, a moving meditation, and a life changing experience for people to achieve their goals.

If you would like more information please contact me for book a firewalking event. Please note there are also break through activities that are available that are additional to fire walking such as board breaking, arrow breaking, and walking on broken glass.


### Energy Seeing Class

Have you ever wanted to learn how to see energy? Well you can. We will learn to play with our ability to perceive energy with all of our senses, but mostly focusing on our ability to see energy. Using our connection to nature, and remembering what we knew as children I will take you on an adventure to reclaim our senses to experience the energy world around us. The world is so much more when we pay attention to it and what surrounds us. You will never experience the world the same way after this class. Seeing and perceiving energy empowers us to live more fully and be more aware of what is around us. Come play with us, awaken your imagination and exploration of what lies around us everyday. Open your creative self.

### Emotion Code

Do you have emotions that are holding you back from what you want to do? Do you keep thinking that you want to release your emotions, but you don’t know how to “get past them”. Sometimes we are depressed, or anxious and we have no idea why. This isn’t your imagination it is old negative emotions that you have felt in your life that are still creating problems for you.

Emotion Code is a simple, powerful method that releases trapped energies in your body. Emotion Code doesn’t need to repeat the story of what happened to you, it simply removes the stuck emotion and the emotional charge connected to the trauma that happened.

We tend to bury our emotions and try not to think about them, but that does not mean that they are gone. The body remembers everything that has happened to it and the energy of these emotions can be trapped your body. These trapped emotions can hold us hostage in negative patterns in our lives.

Emotion Code is an efficient way to release the subconscious emotions that are stuck from the past so we can move forward in our lives, and have the freedom to make better decisions. It can help you with physical pain, relationships, abundance, and generational healing. Emotion Code will help you get your life back and change your life path.
