### Emotion Code

Do you have emotions that are holding you back from what you want to do? Do you keep thinking that you want to release your emotions, but you don’t know how to “get past them”. Sometimes we are depressed, or anxious and we have no idea why. This isn’t your imagination it is old negative emotions that you have felt in your life that are still creating problems for you.

Emotion Code is a simple, powerful method that releases trapped energies in your body. Emotion Code doesn’t need to repeat the story of what happened to you, it simply removes the stuck emotion and the emotional charge connected to the trauma that happened.

We tend to bury our emotions and try not to think about them, but that does not mean that they are gone. The body remembers everything that has happened to it and the energy of these emotions can be trapped your body. These trapped emotions can hold us hostage in negative patterns in our lives.

Emotion Code is an efficient way to release the subconscious emotions that are stuck from the past so we can move forward in our lives, and have the freedom to make better decisions. It can help you with physical pain, relationships, abundance, and generational healing. Emotion Code will help you get your life back and change your life path.
