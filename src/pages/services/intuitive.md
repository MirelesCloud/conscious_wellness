I have always been intuitive even as a child. I remember realizing I could read people when I was very young. I am an intuitive and an empath. It was challenging growing up because I was so sensitive, but I have learned tools to help grow and balance my abilities. My mission is to help other sensitives empower themselves and develop the tools they need to succeed and thrive in their lives.

I know how to hold people in an accepting, and loving way. People need to be held, witnessed, and acknowledged, which is what my sessions are about. I grew up Christian, and I connect to Christ Consciousness and angels during my sessions. I use that unconditional God love space to hold you and really see your energy and what is going on from a neutral perspective. Love is what connects us and is the vehicle of healing.

Some of the things we can work on together is cord cutting to negative people, healing addictions, relationship issues, career path, growth periods, grief, and emotional issues. I am able to see where the energy is stuck in your body, and I empower people to be able to do the same for themselves. My goal is to get you well as soon as possible so you can go out and help others.
